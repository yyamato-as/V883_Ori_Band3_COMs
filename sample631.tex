%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.31 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls and other external packages such as
%% latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf.  Note that as of 
%% Oct 2020, APS now uses revtex4.2e for its journals but remember that 
%% AASTeX v6+ still uses v4.1. All of these external packages should 
%% already be present in the modern TeX distributions but not always.
%% For example, revtex4.1 seems to be missing in the linux version of
%% TexLive 2020. One should be able to get all packages from www.ctan.org.
%% In particular, revtex v4.1 can be found at 
%% https://www.ctan.org/pkg/revtex4-1.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%% using aastex version 6.3
\documentclass[linenumbers, twocolumn, twocolappendix, astrosymb, times]{aastex631}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[arguments]{aastex631}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Supresses an abstract. Originally for RNAAS manuscripts 
%%                but now that abstracts are required this is obsolete for
%%                AAS Journals. Authors might need it for other reasons. DO NOT
%%                use \begin{abstract} and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%   linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%   trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much 
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short 
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations and acknowledgments 
%%                  for dual anonymous review.
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex631}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% Note that in v6.3 "bookmarks" has been changed to "true" in hyperref
%% to improve the accessibility of the compiled pdf file.
%%
%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.

%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.31
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to 
%% keep the traditional author+affiliation information but only show
%% subsets. The \collaboration command now must appear AFTER the group
%% of authors in the collaboration and it takes TWO arguments. The last
%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the 
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to 
%% show a subset of authors.
%
%\AuthorCollaborationLimit=2
%
%% will only show Schwarz & Muench on the front page of the manuscript
%% (assuming the \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands are
%% commented out).
%%
%% Note that all of the author will be shown in the published article.
%% This feature is meant to be used prior to acceptance to make the
%% front end of a long author article more manageable. Please do not use
%% this functionality for manuscripts with less than 20 authors. Conversely,
%% please do use this when the number of authors exceeds 40.
%%
%% Use \allauthors at the manuscript end to show the full author list.
%% This command should only be used with \AuthorCollaborationLimit is used.

%% The following command can be used to set the latex table counters.  It
%% is needed in this document because it uses a mix of latex tabular and
%% AASTeX deluxetables.  In general it should not be needed.

\title{ALMA Band 3 Observations of the V883 Ori disk}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.31 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.31 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.31 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

%% Note that the \and command from previous versions of AASTeX is now
%% depreciated in this version as it is no longer necessary. AASTeX 
%% automatically takes care of all commas and "and"s between authors names.

%% AASTeX 6.31 has the new \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands to
%% provide the collaboration status of a group of authors. These commands 
%% can be used either before or after the list of corresponding authors. The
%% argument for \collaboration is the collaboration identifier. Authors are
%% encouraged to surround collaboration identifiers with ()s. The 
%% \nocollaboration command takes no argument and exists to indicate that
%% the nearby authors are not part of surrounding collaborations.

%% Mark off the abstract in the ``abstract'' environment. 
\begin{abstract}

% \textcolor{red}{abstract here.} 250 word limit

\end{abstract}

%% Keywords should appear after the \end{abstract} command. 
%% The AAS Journals now uses Unified Astronomy Thesaurus concepts:
%% https://astrothesaurus.org
%% You will be asked to selected these concepts during the submission process
%% but this old "keyword" functionality is maintained in case authors want
%% to include these concepts in their preprints.
%% \keywords{Classical Novae (251) --- Ultraviolet astronomy(1736) --- History of astronomy(1868) --- Interdisciplinary astronomy(804)}

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.
%%
%% We recommend that authors also use the natbib \citep
%% and \citet commands to identify citations.  The citations are
%% tied to the reference list via symbolic KEYs. The KEY corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \bibitem in the reference list below. 

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item COMs are key to understanding the molecular evolution from the ISM to planetary materials...
%     \item Young bursting star like V883 Ori provide a unique opportunity to explore the COMs chemistry in young protoplanetary disks
%     \item Many COMs lines have been detected in Band 5, 6, and 7 observations.
%     \item However, its column density and abundance ratio estimation is suffered from the dust opacity effect in higher band of ALMA
%     \item we report the ALMA Band 3 observations, where the dust opacity effect should be minimized, and evaluate the column density of COMs correctly
% \end{itemize}

\section{Observation and data reduction} \label{sec:observation}

\subsection{ALMA Band 3 Observations}
V883 Ori was observed in Band 3 during ALMA Cycle 8 (project code: 2021.1.00357.S, PI: S. Notsu). Observations were performed in a total of four executions, one of which was with an extended antenna configuration and other three of which are with a compact antenna configuration. The observation dates, number of antennas, on-source integration time, precipitable water vapor (PWV), baseline coverage, angular resolution, Maximum recoverable scale (MRS), and calibrator information are listed in Table \ref{tab:observations}. 

The correlator setup included eleven spectral windows (SPWs) in Frequency Division Mode (FDM), one of which was dedicated to continuum acquisition with a wide bandwidth of 937.5\,MHz for an accurate determination of the continuum level. The frequency resolution of the continuum SPW was 0.488\,MHz, resulting in a velocity resolution of $\sim$1.5\,km \,s$^{-1}$. The continuum SPW included many spectral lines detected as well, which are analyzed in this work. Other ten SPWs targeted specific spectral lines with narrower bandwidths of 58.59\,MHz or 117.19\,MHz, which also covered many COMs lines. The frequency resolution of these SPWs was 0.141\,MHz, resulting in a velocity resolution of $\sim$0.4--0.5\,km\,s$^{-1}$. 
% For all SPWs, the spectral averaging factor was set to 1, and thus the native channel width was half the spectral resolution. 
The detailed properties of the SPWs are summarized in Table \ref{tab:cube_properties}. We note that two SPWs (8 and 9) were partially overlapping each other, and only the wider SPW 9 is used for analysis. We also note that the primary target of this observation was two protonated carbon dioxide (\hcotp) lines, which will be presented in future work (Notsu et al. in prep.). This paper focuses on a large number of COMs lines covered with these SPWs.


\subsection{Calibration and Imaging}
The initial calibrations were performed by the ALMA staff using the standard ALMA calibration pipeline version 2021.2.0.128. Subsequent self-calibration and imaging were conducted using the Common Astronomy Software Applications \citep[CASA;][]{CASA} version 6.2.1.7. The pipeline-calibrated data were first imaged without any deconvolutions (i.e., dirty imaging) or continuum-subtractions to specify the line-free channels precisely by visually inspecting the dirty image cubes. These line-free channels are averaged to obtain continuum visibilities. Self-calibration was subsequently conducted using the continuum visibilities with the CASA tasks \texttt{gaincal} and \texttt{applycal}. One round of the phase-only and phase plus amplitude self-calibration were first performed on the data with a compact antenna configuration. The data with extended antenna configurations were then concatenated and self-calibrated together. Two rounds of the phase-only self-calibration and one round of the phase plus amplitude self-calibration were performed on the combined data. The solutions were then applied to the spectral line visibilities.
% , which were then continuum-subtracted using the CASA task \texttt{uvcontsub}. 

Each of the SPWs was imaged with the CASA task \texttt{tclean} \citep{Hogbom1974} using Briggs weighting (\texttt{robust} $=$ 0.5). The \texttt{tclean} task was run in parallel mode using \texttt{mpicasa} implementation. As a specific weighting scheme, \texttt{briggsbwtaper} is adopted with independent weight densities for each channel (i.e., \texttt{perchanweightdensity = True}) to achieve more uniform sensitivity over whole channels. For each SPW, a common restoring beam across all channels is used. A few channels at the edge of the SPW are removed during the imaging process because of the large deviation of the beam size caused by a slight difference in the frequency coverage between the data with compact and extended antenna configurations\footnote{see \url{https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/memo-series.html\#Correcting-bad-common-beam}.}. All SPWs were CLEANed down to 3\,$\times$\,RMS with the native channel widths. Automatic masking algorithm with \texttt{automultithresh} was also adopted to generate the CLEAN mask. The typical beam size and the RMS noise level were $\sim0\farcs3$--$0\farcs4$ and 0.6--1\,mJy\,beam$^{-1}$, respectively. The RMS noise level was measured on the images without the primary beam correction. The beam sizes and RMS noise levels for each SPW are listed in Table \ref{tab:cube_properties}. Finally, the continuum component is subtracted from these image cubes using the CASA task \texttt{imcontsub} to produce the spectral-line-only image cubes. The continuum subtraction on the image plane rather than the visibility plane (e.g., with the CASA task \texttt{uvcontsub}) mitigates the Jorsater \& van Moorsel (JvM) effect \citep{JvM, Czekala2021} on the line emission, which is critical for the flux scale, as much as possible (see Appendix \ref{appendix:JvM_effect}). Throughout this paper, we use the image cubes which is continuum-subtracted on the image plane unless states otherwise.

% \subsection{JvM Correction}\label{subsec:JvM_correction}
% The restored images with the default CLEANing process were further processed to account for the Jorsater \& van Moorsel \citep[][hereafter JvM]{JvM} effect: the JvM correction. Due to the inconsistency between the units of the residual image (in Jy per dirty beam) and the model image (in Jy per CLEAN beam), the flux scale in the CLEANed image can be incorrect, particularly for the faint emission. We followed the approach described in \citet{Czekala2021}, where the correction is made by rescaling the residual image by the ratio of the CLEAN beam and dirty beam volumes ($\epsilon$). The JvM $\epsilon$ is $\approx$ 0.29 for all SPWs as listed in Table \ref{tab:cube_properties}. The small $\epsilon$ values indicate that the effect is severe, as expected for the dataset combined with different antenna configurations \citep{Czekala2021}. While the JvM correction recovers the correct flux scale on the CLEANed image, which is critical for determining molecular column densities and temperatures, \citet{Casassus2022} cautioned that the JvM correction may exaggerate the S/N of the emission by artificially reducing the noise level. We thus show the spectra extracted from the JvM-uncorrected images as well in Appendix \ref{}, to ensure that the detections of molecular line emission are statistically significant. 
% After the JvM correction, the primary beam correction was also applied to the JvM-corrected image cubes. Throughout this paper, we use the JvM-corrected, primary-beam-corrected images, unless otherwise stated.

\section{Data Analysis and Result}\label{sec:analysis_result}
\subsection{Spectrum Extraction and Line Identification}\label{subsec:line_identification}
Figure \ref{fig:spectra_gallery} shows the spectra which are integrated over 1\farcs2 aperture and corrected for the line broadening due to the Keplerian rotation of the disk. The original disk-integrated spectra are shown in Figure \ref{} in Appendix \ref{}. To obtain the spectra corrected for the Keplerian line broadening, we used \texttt{integrated\_spectrum()} function implemented in \texttt{GoFish} package \citep{GoFish}. This method first deprojects the disk and then aligns the Dopper-shifted spectra at each position within the disk to a common velocity (systemic velocity of the source) to recover the single-peak spectra for each transitions, facilitating the identification of the blended transitions. In this procedure, we assumed a position angle (32\arcdeg) and inclination angle (38.3\arcdeg) of the disk, a central stellar mass of $1.29\,M_\odot$, and a distance of 400\,pc, based on previous works \citep{Cieza2016, Tobin2023}. We also assumed that the emission is originating from the midplane of the disk and did not consider the vertical extent of the emission. The uncertainties of the spectra were calculated per channel basis within the \texttt{integrated\_spectrum()} function taking the spectral decorrelation \citep{Yen2016} into account.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:spectra_gallery}, numerous spectral features are detected in the disk-integrated spectra. As many COMs transitions exists in narrow frequency ranges and they are usually overlapped between different species, a visual identification of the lines is challenging. Alternatively, we fitted a synthetic spectra to the observed spectra to identify each of these features. The details of the synthetic spectral model is described in Appendix \ref{}. Briefly, the model used a common emitting region size, a common excitation temperature, and a common line width under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions, and the emitting region size, excitation temperature, line width, and the column density of each species are varied to fit the observed spectra and test if they can be reproduced with the model. For the construction of the model, the spectroscopic data of the molecular lines are taken from the Jet Propulsion Spectroscopy \citep[JPL;][]{JPL} and the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy \citep[CDMS;][]{CDMS1, CDMS2, CDMS3} as detailed in Appendix \ref{appendix:spectroscopic_data}. Only the transitions with an Einstein A coefficient for spontaneous emission of $\geq10^{-8}$\,s$^{-1}$ and an upper state energy of $\leq1000$\,K are considered in the model.

Following \citet{Jorgensen2020}, the line identification criteria are (1) the synthetic spectrum of multiple (more than one) transitions of a given species is accounted for the observed spectra including at least one detected transitions unblended with transitions of other species, and (2) no undetected transitions are over-predicted with the synthetic spectrum. Species that fulfill (2) but with a single (unblended) transition being detected are considered as a tentative identification. Based on these criteria, we firmly identified 11 species and their isotopologues: \methanol, \acetaldehyde, \methylformate, \dimethylether, \ethyleneoxide, \acetone, \propenal, \propanal, $^{13}$CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$O$^{13}$CHO, and CH$_3^{13}$CHO. We also tentatively identified 5 species and isotopologues: $^{13}$CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_2$DOH, CH$_2$DCHO, CH$_3$CDO, and C$_2$H$_3$CN. In addition, one transition of each sulfur-bearing molecule (OCS and SO$_2$) was detected. The identified transitions are listed in Table \ref{tab:transitions} in Appendix \ref{appendix:transitions}.



% The identification of species is based on the number of transitions detected; if multiple transitions of the species are detected at $>3\sigma$ in the stacked spectra, we regard that species as a firm identification. If only one transition is detected at $>3\sigma$ in the stacked spectra, it is considered as a tentative identification.

% The uncertainties of the original spectra were calculated in each channel as $\sqrt{\mathrm{\Omega_\mathrm{aperture}/\Omega_\mathrm{beam}}} \times \sigma$, where $\Omega_\mathrm{aperture}$, $\Omega_\mathrm{beam}$ and $\sigma$ are the aperture area, the beam area, and the image RMS, respectively. 

% Figure \ref{fig}(a) shows the continuum image of the V883 Ori disk at $\sim$ 3\,mm. The continuum emission was imaged with a Briggs weighting (robust $=0.5$). The beam size and RMS noise level of the continuum image were 0.4 x 0.3 and xx mJy beam-1, respectively. The continuum emission associated with the V883 Ori disk is marginally spatially resolved, and its extent is in agreement with the previous observations with higher angular resolution \citep{Cieza2016}.

\subsection{Spatial Distributions}
\subsubsection{Velocity-integrated Intensity Maps}
Figure \ref{fig:moment_zero_gallery} shows the velocity-integrated intensity map (zeroth moment map) of the selected transitions without significant blending with other species. These maps are created using \texttt{bettermoments} \citep{bettermoments} by integrating over the velocity range of $\pm3.5$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the source systemic velocity ($v_\mathrm{sys} = 4.25$ km s$^{-1}$; \citealt{Tobin2023}) without any masking. For \dimethylether and \acetone, multiple blended transitions of each species are integrated together. For these molecules, the integration range is the combination of the default integration range ($\pm3.5$ km s$^{-1}$) for the blended multiple transitions. The molecular line emission are all confined to the disk region and marginally spatially resolved. While the spatial extent of the emission is consistent with the previous observations in Bands 6 and 7 \citep{vantHoff2018, Lee2019, Tobin2023} considering the difference in the beam size, the central emission cavities seen in the Band 6 and 7 data are not detected in these maps at the current spatial resolution of $\sim0\farcs3$.
% We will discuss the spatial distributions of COM emission in more detail in Section \ref{subsubsec:spatial_dist}.

\subsubsection{Line Profile Analysis}\label{subsubsec:line_profile_analysis}
As the disk emission is only marginally spatially resolved, it is difficult to directly infer the distribution of emission in the inner region, particularly the cavity region seen in sub-mm observations \citep{vantHoff2018, Lee2019, Tobin2023}. Alternatively, we can indirectly probe the emission in the inner region which is not spatially resolved in the velocity-integrated intensity maps (Figure \ref{fig:moment_zero_gallery}) from the line profile assuming gas kinematics. If we assume that the observed gas follows the Keplerian rotation, the high-velocity components with respect to the systemic velocity, or the line wings, purely contains information about the emission from the inner region. The maximum velocity of Keplerian rotation as a function of disk radius ($v_\mathrm{max}(r)$) can be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Keplerian_rotation}
    v_\mathrm{max}(r) = \sqrt{\frac{GM_\star}{r}}\sin i,
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M_\star$ is the central stellar mass, and $i$ is the inclination of the disk. We inspected the line profile of three bright transitions of \methanol, \acetaldehyde, and \methylformate, which have enough sensitivity to the line wings, and compared them with the maximum velocity of Keplerian rotation in Figure \ref{fig:line_profile}. As seen in the line wings of each line profile, no significant emission is detected in the velocity channels which corresponds to inside $\sim$ 40 au radius. The channel maps (Figure \ref{}) also show that there are no significant emission inside $\lesssim$ 40 au radius. 

\begin{figure*}
\epsscale{1.15}
\plotone{line_profile_comparison.pdf}
\caption{Line profiles of \methanol $2_{-1,1}$ -- $1_{-1,0}$ E $v_t=0$, \acetaldehyde $5_{2,3}$ -- $4_{2,2}$ E $v_t=0$, and \methylformate $7_{6,1}$ -- $6_{6,0}$ E $v_t=0$. The vertical dotted line marks the systemic velocity (4.25 km s$^{-1}$). The vertical blue-ish dashed lines indicates the corresponding disk radii at each channel based on the maximum velocity of Keplerian rotation in Equation (\ref{eq:Keplerian_rotation}). The horizontal dashed line indicates the zero-flux level. There are no significant detection of emission in the channels which corresponds to inside $\sim$ 40\,au radius.}
\label{fig:line_profile}
\end{figure*}

To evaluate the contribution from the emission at each radius quantitatively, we employed a forward modeling approach to reconstruct the radial intensity profiles from the line profiles \citep{Bosman2021}. Using the relation in Equation (\ref{eq:Keplerian_rotation}), the radial intensity profile (as a function of radius) can be constructed from the line profile (as a function of velocity) as demonstrated in \citet{Bosman2021}. We employed a similar approach to that used in \citet{Bosman2021} to construct the radial intensity profiles of aforementioned three bright transitions from their line profiles. The details of modeling are found in Appendix \ref{}. Figure \ref{fig:radial_profile_from_line_profile} show the reconstructed radial intensity profiles of these three transitions. All three transitions shows the depression at the innermost region with a radial peak at $\sim$ 50--60 au, which is consistent with the higher-resolution Band 6 profile. This suggests that the bulk of the observed Band 3 emission can be explained by the emission from the 40--80 au region, and the inner cavity likely exists in Band 3 emission as well. 
% We note that, however, the uncertainty of the intensity profile is quite large.

The grey dashed curve shows the radial intensity profile of \methanol transition in Band 6 created by deprojection and azimuthal averaging on the higher-resolution ($\sim$ 0\farcs1) velocity-integrated intensity maps \citep{Tobin2023}. The Band 6 profile is normalized by its radial peak being matched to the radial peak of the Band 3 \methanol profile.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Column Density Retrieval}\label{subsubsec:spectral_fit}
To derive the disk-averaged column density of each species, we first employ a simultaneous fit of an LTE spectral model of different species to the extracted spectra, taking the spectral blending and line optical depth into account. The same model as that used for line identification is used (see Appendix \ref{appendix:spectral_model} for details), where all species (tentatively) identified as in Section \ref{subsec:line_identification} are considered. We excluded the optically thick ($\tau > 0.2$) transitions from the fit to reduce the optical depth effect. The selection for the excluded transitions is based on the optical depth at the line center in the best-fit model of the fit for line identification (Section \ref{subsec:line_identification}). This selection excluded the transitions of abundant species (e.g., \methanol, \methylformate, and \acetaldehyde) with a large Einstein A coefficient and a relatively low upper state energy. The excluded transitions are indicated in Table \ref{tab:transitions}.

The emitting region area is fixed based on the previous Band 6 observations \citep{Tobin2023}. As the emission is only marginally spatially resolved, we assumed that the emitting region in Band 3 is the same as that of \methanol in Band 6 \citep{Tobin2023}. The assumed inner and outer radius of the emitting area is 0\farcs1 and 0\farcs3, respectively. 
% This facilitates the direct comparison of the column density of COMs. 
In addition to the (tentatively) identified transitions in Section \ref{subsec:line_identification}, we included several species in the spectral fit: $^{13}$CH$_3$CHO, CH$_2$DOCHO, and CH$_3$OCDO. In total, we consider 24 physical parameters; excitation temperature ($T_\mathrm{ex}$), line width ($\Delta V_\mathrm{FWHM}$), column density of 21 species, and an additional parameter $\gamma$ for line broadening (see Appendix \ref{appendix:spectral_model}). 
% In addition, we properly consider the flux calibration uncertainty and the data correlation between spectral channels originating from the Hanning smoothing applied in the correlator and the procedure to correct for the line broadening due to the Kepelerian rotation (Section \ref{subsec:line_identification}). The detailed procedure are described in Appendices. 
We employed the affine-invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm implemented in the \texttt{emcee} package \citep{emcee} to explore the parameter spaces. We run 100 walkers for 15000 steps, and the initial 12000 steps are discarded as burn-in. Figure \ref{fig:spectral_fit_demo} demonstrates the unique capability of the simultaneous spectral fit to fully utilize the transitions for column density derivation even with severe spectral blending. 

The results of the fits are summarized in Table \ref{tab:specfit_result}. The derived excitation temperature is $\sim100$\,K, indicative of the thermal sublimation of molecules. The column densities of COMs are $\sim$10$^{15}$--10$^{18}$, which is broadly consistent with the previous estimates with Band 6 data \citep{Lee2019}. 
% While both fits obtained similarly high excitation temperatures of $\sim100$\,K indicative of ice sublimation, the column density of molecules are significantly different between the two fits. In the fit with $R_\mathrm{s}$ being a free parameter, the emitting radius is smaller than that of in Band 6 (0\farcs3) by a factor of $\sim2$, and the column density of molecules are thus higher than that in the fit with a fixed emitting radius by factors of $\sim$ 4--8.

% \subsubsection{Integrated Intensity Analysis}
% % The spectral analysis described in the previous section uses the spectra aligned for Keplerian rotation. As the emission is only marginally spatially resolved, this procedure of the spectral alignment might have some additional uncertainty 
% To validate the results of the spectral analysis described in Section \ref{subsubsec:spectral_fit}, we also complementarily employed the analysis of the velocity-integrated intensities \citep[e.g.,][]{Goldsmith1999} for three species (\methanol, \methylformate, and \acetaldehyde) whose transitions without line blending are detected in a sufficient number for this analysis. Following \citet{Goldsmith1999}, the column density of molecules in the upper state of each transition under the assumption of optically thin emission, $N_\mathrm{u}^{\mathrm{thin}}$, can be related to the disk-integrated flux density $S_\nu$,
% \begin{equation}
%     N_\mathrm{u}^\mathrm{thin} = \frac{4\pi S_\nu \Delta v}{A_\mathrm{ul}\Omega hc},
% \end{equation}
% where $A_\mathrm{ul}$ is the Einstein A coefficient, $\Delta v$ is the line width, and $\Omega$ is the solid angle of the emitting region. In the case where the optical depth is not negligible ($\tau \nll 1$), the upper state column density $N_\mathrm{u}^\mathrm{thin}$ needs to be scaled by an optical depth correction factor,
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:tau_correction_factor}
%     C_\tau = \frac{\tau}{1 - e^{-\tau}},
% \end{equation}
% to obtain the correct upper state column density, i.e., $N_\mathrm{u} = N_\mathrm{u}^\mathrm{thin} C_\tau$ \citep{Goldsmith1999}. The upper state column density $N_\mathrm{u}$ is then related to the total column density $N$ by the Boltzmann equation,
% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{N_\mathrm{u}}{g_\mathrm{u}} = \frac{N}{Q(T_\mathrm{ex})}e^{-E_\mathrm{u} / k_\mathrm{B} T_\mathrm{ex}},
% \end{equation}
% where $g_\mathrm{u}$ is the upper state degeneracy of each transition, $Q$ is the partition function of the molecule, $T_\mathrm{ex}$ is the excitation temperature, and $E_\mathrm{u}$ is the upper state energy of each transition. Taking the logarithm of this equation yields the conventional rotation diagram as in \citet{Goldsmith1999},
% \begin{equation}
%     \ln\frac{N_\mathrm{u}}{g_\mathrm{u}} = \ln N - \ln Q(T_\mathrm{ex}) - \frac{E_\mathrm{u}}{k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{ex}},
% \end{equation}
% or, expressing the optical depth correction factor explicitly,
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:rotation_diagram}
%     \ln\frac{N_\mathrm{u}^\mathrm{thin}}{g_\mathrm{u}} + \ln C_\tau = \ln N - \ln Q(T_\mathrm{ex}) - \frac{E_\mathrm{u}}{k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{ex}}.
% \end{equation}
% The optical depth $\tau$ can be related back to the upper state column density of each transition by 
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:optical_depth}
%     \tau = \frac{c^3A_\mathrm{ul}N_\mathrm{u}}{8\pi\nu^3\Delta V_\mathrm{FWHM}}\left(e^{h\nu/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{ex}} - 1\right),
% \end{equation}
% which makes it possible to write down a likelihood function $\mathcal{L}(N, T_\mathrm{ex})$ from Equation (\ref{eq:rotation_diagram}) to optimize these parameters. 

% To conduct this analysis, we first correctly measured the velocity-integrated flux density ($S_\nu\Delta v$) of each transition by applying a Keplerian mask to the image cubes. Since even the Keplerian masking could not resolve the spectral blending due to the limited spatial/spectral resolution, blended transitions were excluded from the measurement except for two blended \methanol transitions $21_{6,16}$ -- $22_{5,17}$ A $v_t=0$ and $21_{6,15}$ -- $22_{5,18}$ A $v_t=0$, each of whose velocity-integrated flux density is measured by dividing the sum of these transitions by two as the intrinsic strength of these transitions are same (see Table \ref{tab:flux_density}). These transitions are critical for this analysis as the number of optically thin \methanol transitions are insufficient (one) if these transitions were excluded. To construct the Keplerian mask, we used the aforementioned disk parameters (see Section \ref{subsec:line_identification}) and an inner radius and outer radius of 0\farcs05 and 0\farcs3, respectively. The Keplerian mask is convolved with the observing beam, and then used to extract the spectrum. We confirmed that the beam-convolved Keplerian mask is apparently encompassing the observed emission. The extracted spectra for each transition are shown in Figure \ref{fig:CH3OH_spectra}, \ref{fig:CH3OCHO_spectra}, and \ref{fig:CH3CHO_spectra} in Appendix \ref{appendix:spectra}. The uncertainty of the spectra is calculated at per-channel basis as $\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{mask}/\Omega_\mathrm{beam}}\times\sigma_\mathrm{RMS}$, where $\Omega_\mathrm{mask}$ is the solid angle of the Keplerian mask in each channel, $\Omega_\mathrm{beam}$ is the solid angle of the beam, and $\sigma_\mathrm{RMS}$ is the channel RMS reported in Table \ref{tab:cube_properties}. The velocity-integrated flux densities were measured by integrating the spectra along the velocity axis, i.e., $S_\nu\Delta v = \sum_i S_{\nu, i}\,\Delta v_\mathrm{chan}$, where $i$ is the index for each channel and $\Delta v_\mathrm{chan}$ is the channel width. The uncertainties of the flux densities were calculated as $\sqrt{\Delta v_\mathrm{res}/\Delta v_\mathrm{chan}}\,\times\sqrt{\sum_i (dS_{\nu, i})^2}\,\Delta v_\mathrm{chan}$, where $\Delta v_\mathrm{res}$ and $dS_{\nu, i}$ are the velocity resolution (Table \ref{tab:cube_properties}) and the uncertainty of the spectra, respectively. The additional factor of $\sqrt{\Delta v_\mathrm{chan}/\Delta v_\mathrm{res}}$ accounts for the correlation between channels due to the narrower channel width than the velocity resolution. The measured flux densities are reported in Table \ref{tab:flux_density} with spectroscopic data of each transition.

% For the solid angle of emitting region $\Omega$ and the line width $\Delta V_\mathrm{FWHM}$ in Equation (\ref{eq:optical_depth}), we assumed the same values in the spectral analysis. The inner and outer radii of the emitting region size are $0\farcs1$ and $0\farcs3$, respectively, and the line width is fixed to the best-fit value of the spectral analysis (0.7 km s$^{-1}$).

% % We first tried to fit using all transitions listed in Table \ref{tab:flux_density}, from which we excluded highly optically thick transitions ($\tau \gg 1$) as they could trace the different temperature regions (e.g., vertical temperature gradient) and were not fitted well even with the optical depth correction factor (Equation \ref{eq:tau_correction_factor}). 
% The same transitions as those in the spectral analysis (Section \ref{subsubsec:spectral_fit}) are excluded from the fit as well for the same reason (optical depth). The excluded transitions are marked in Table \ref{tab:flux_density}. We sampled the posterior probability distributions of $N$ and $T_\mathrm{ex}$ using the \texttt{emcee} package \citep{emcee}. For both fits, we run 32 walkers for 1000 steps, and the initial 500 steps are discarded as burn-in. The $N_\mathrm{u}/g_\mathrm{u}$ values of the observed transitions are plotted against $E_\mathrm{u}$ in Figure \ref{fig:rotdiag_0.3arcsec} and \ref{fig:rotdiag_0.15arcsec} with models generated from ($N, T_\mathrm{ex}$) pairs randomly selected from the posterior distributions.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
\subsection{Comparison to the sub-mm observations}
% \subsubsection{Spatial Distributions}\label{subsubsec:spatial_dist}
The spatial distributions of the COM emission in Band 3, where the dust continuum emission would be fainter than the sub-mm regime, are essential information to infer the origin of the inner cavity seen in the sub-mm observations. If the central region where the emission cavity is seen in Band 6/7 is filled with COM emission in Band 3, it would be evidence that the COM emission is reduced in sub-mm observations due to the intense dust continuum emission. 

We found that while the spatial distributions of various COM emission in Band 3 are commonly centrally-peaked in velocity-integrated intensity maps (Figure \ref{fig:moment_zero_gallery}), the reconstructed radial intensity profiles (Figure \ref{fig:radial_profile_from_line_profile}) show the inner depression of the emission. This indicates that the inner emission cavity is smeared out by the beam on the velocity-integrated intensity maps. We confirmed that the reconstructed radial intensity profiles (Figure \ref{fig:radial_profile_from_line_profile}) and the radial intensity profile of \methanol in Band 6\footnote{Created by deprojecting and azimuthally averaging the velocity-integrated intensity map taken from the Harvard Dataverse repository (\url{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MDQJEU)})} \citep{Tobin2023} are both centrally peaked and consistent with those created from the velocity-integrated intensity maps (Figure \ref{fig:moment_zero_gallery}) when they are smoothed to the same spatial resolution as that of the presented Band 3 data. The reconstructed radial intensity profiles commonly have radial peaks at $\sim$ 50--60\,au, which is consistent with the higher-resolution Band 6 profile (Figure \ref{fig:radial_profile_from_line_profile}), although the uncertainties of the profiles are quite large. Therefore, it is likely that the emission observed in Band 3 mainly traces the components outside the cavity ($\gtrsim 40\,$ au, i.e., the same component as that traced by the sub-mm observations). We note that, however, there are some additional systematic uncertainties on the reconstructed radial intensity profiles (Figure \ref{fig:radial_profile_from_line_profile}). In reality, the molecular line emission could originate from the disk surface \citep[or the warm molecular layer,][]{Aikawa2002, Law2021, Law2022, Law2023, PanequeCarreno2023}, where the Keplerian velocity is slightly smaller than that in the midplane. Indeed, the COM emission in the V883 Ori disk also shows evidence of the elevated emission surfaces in the higher-resolution Band 6 data (Leemker et al. in prep.). This invalidates the assumption that the emission is fully originating from the disk midplane, which we made in the reconstruction of the radial intensity profiles. Therefore, while the depression of the emission in the innermost region is robust, the actual emission cavity sizes in Band 3 data are rather uncertain. 
To fully reveal the emission distribution and COM chemistry in the innermost region of the V883 Ori disk, higher-resolution observations in Band 3 (or further longer wavelength such as Band 1 and VLA/ngVLA) and the detailed combined analysis of the line emission and continuum emission will be necessary.
% Furthermore, there could be a deviation from the Keplerian rotation in the innermost region, which again complicates the reconstruction process. 

% which is different from the sub-mm observations \citep{vantHoff2018, Lee2019, Tobin2023}. While this may indicate that the Band 3 observations traces the emission from the cavity region in sub-mm, the spatial resolution of the presented Band 3 observations is insufficient to conclude so. We compare the radial intensity profile of \methanol emission along the disk major axis (P.A. $= 32\arcdeg$) in Band 3 and Band 6 in Figure \ref{fig:radial_profile_CH3OH} (The Band 6 data is based on \citealt{Tobin2023}\footnote{Taken from the Harvard Dataverse repository \url{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MDQJEU}}). The Band 6 intensity profile is created from the higher resolution data ($\sim0\farcs1$ beam) than the Band 3 data. The Band 6 data was smoothed to the same beam size as that in Band 3 using the CASA task \texttt{imsmooth} to facilitate the direct comparison to the Band 3 data. The direction of the disk major axis is almost same as the direction of the minor axis of the Band 3 beam, which has the maximum potential to spatially resolve the COM emission. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:radial_profile_CH3OH}, even the Band 6 data which shows the inner cavity with the original resolutions \citep{Tobin2023} shows a centrally-peaked profile with the Band 3 beam, which is quite similar to that of the Band 3 data. These similar profiles indicate that the COM emission in both Band 6 and Band 3 traces the same component, or at least there are no predominant component from the cavity region in the Band 3 data.

% We also examined the channel map of the COM emission in Band 3 (Figure \ref{fig:channelmap_CH3OH}, \ref{fig:channelmap_CH3OCHO}, and \ref{fig:channelmap_CH3CHO} in Appendix \ref{appendix:channel_maps}) to search for the potential signals from the cavity region. Assuming that the COM gas follows the Keplerian rotation, the high-velocity components purely traces the emission from the inner region, allowing for the direct inspection of more inner region than that explored by the velocity-integrated maps. The channel maps of the brightest transitions of \methanol, \methylformate, and \acetaldehyde, which should be most sensitive to the innermost region with a given observing sensitivity, are shown as representatives. The channel map shows that the emission is mainly originating from the velocity range of $v_\mathrm{sys} \pm 3.5$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to the radius of $\gtrsim 40$ au on the assumption that the emission completely follows the Keplerian rotation, although faint emission ($\sim3\sigma$) are seen in a few channels which correspond to 20--30 au. 

% In summary, it is likely that the emission observed in the Band 3 observations mainly traces the components outside the cavity ($\gtrsim 40\,$ au, i.e., the same component as that traced by the sub-mm observations) with a potential small additional contribution from more inner region.

% \subsubsection{Column Densities}
% Disk-averaged column density is an alternative probe of the emission cavity, even without directly spatially resolving the cavity region. If the Band 3 observations trace more inner region in addition to the component observed in sub-mm (i.e., outside the cavity), the disk-averaged column densities of COMs based on the Band 3 data should be systematically larger than those based on sub-mm data. With the presented Band 3 observations, we found no systematic increases in column densities of COMs compared to those based on the sub-mm observations (Table \ref{tab:specfit_result}). This naturally indicates that the Band 3 observations traces the same emission component with that traced by the sub-mm observations, consistent with the implication from the spatial distributions (Section \ref{subsubsec:spatial_dist}).

\subsection{The physical and chemical structure of the innermost region of the V883 Ori disk}\label{subsec:physicochemical_structure}
The presented Band 3 observations suggest that the COM line emission in Band 3 also shows the inner depression at $\lesssim$ 40 au radius. Here we discuss the possible origins of the inner depression and the associated physical and chemical structures of the V883 Ori disk. 

% \subsubsection{Bright dust continuum emission hiding the molecular lines}
The first possible explanations for the observed depression of the COM emission in Band 3 are that the dust continuum emission is still too intense even in Band 3 for the line emission to be detected in the innermost disk. In sub-mm wavelengths, the dust continuum emission at $\lesssim$ 40 au radius has been proven to be optically thick ($\tau \gtrsim 2$) by the intra-band analysis of the ALMA Band 6 observations with higher resolution ($\sim0\farcs04$; \citealt{Cieza2016}). Since the dust opacity is smaller in lower frequencies in general, the dust continuum emission is expected to be more optically thin in the longer wavelength regime such as ALMA Band 3. 

However, the factors that affects the line intensity are not only the dust optical depth, but also the temperature of the dust emitting layer. In a simple slab model prescription with the assumption of LTE, if the line emitting layer is well separated and elevated from the dust emitting layer (near the midplane) with the line emitting layer being closer to the observer \citep[see e.g.,][Takakuwa et al. in prep.]{Bosman2021}, the observed line intensity after the continuum subtraction is expressed as 
\begin{align}\label{equation:line_intensity_separated}
    I_\mathrm{L-C} &= B_\nu(T_\mathrm{gas})(1 - e^{-\tau_\mathrm{line}}) + I_{\nu, \mathrm{dust}}e^{-\tau_\mathrm{line}} - I_{\nu, \mathrm{dust}} \notag \\
    &= (B_\nu(T_\mathrm{gas}) - I_{\nu, \mathrm{dust}})(1 - e^{-\tau_\mathrm{line}}),
\end{align}
where $B_\nu$ is the Planck function for blackbody radiation, $T_\mathrm{gas}$ is the gas temperature representing the temperature of the line emitting region, $\tau_\mathrm{line}$ is the optical depth of the line emission at the line center, and $I_{\nu, \mathrm{dust}} = \chi B_\nu(T_\mathrm{dust})(1 - e^{-\tau_\mathrm{dust}})$ is the intensity of the dust continuum emission. Here $\chi$ is the intensity reduction factor owing to the scattering effect \citep[e.g.,][]{Bosman2021}, $T_\mathrm{dust}$ is the dust temperature, and $\tau_\mathrm{dust}$ is the optical depth of the dust continuum emission. If we assume that the dust continuum emission is optically thick (i.e., $1 - e^{\tau_\mathrm{dust}} \sim 1$) and the temperature of the line and dust emitting region is the same (i.e., $T_\mathrm{gas} = T_\mathrm{dust}$, vertically isothermal disk), Equation (\ref{equation:line_intensity_separated}) will be reduced to the case discussed in \citet{Bosman2021}.

In archetypal disks where the temperature structure is determined mostly by the passive irradiation from the central star, the temperature in the line emitting region ($T_\mathrm{gas}$) is usually much higher than the temperature in the disk midplane from which the dust emission is mostly originating ($T_\mathrm{dust}$), allowing us to observe the line emission originating from the disk surface. However, in the case of the V883 Ori disk, where the disk temperature is expected to be elevated due to the accretion outburst, the viscous heating can be efficient in the midplane, which could make the temperature in the disk midplane ($T_\mathrm{dust}$) higher than that in the archetypal disk. Indeed, \citet{Lee2019} suggests that the intensity depression of the COM emission can be reproduced by the presence of the additional heating in the midplane. This warmer temperature in the midplane makes it further challenging to detect the line emission originating from its emitting layer closer to the observer, even if the optical depth of the dust continuum emission is not so high, although the intensity of the dust emission also depends on the scattering effect ($\chi$). 

Although the picture that the line emitting layer is separated and elevated from the dust emitting layer in the disk midplane is supported by the emission surface analysis of the Band 6 data (Leemker et al. in prep.), the bulk of the line emission in the innermost region ($\lesssim$ 40 au radius) can be well mixed with the dust emission and originating from the disk midplane, since the high emission surface of COM emission derived from the analysis of Band 6 data (Leemker et al. in prep.) is based on the emission from the outer region ($\gtrsim$ 40 au radius). In this case, the observed line intensity after the continuum subtraction will completely disappear when the line opacity is negligible compared to the dust opacity (see \citealt{Bosman2021}, Equation (4)). 

\textcolor{red}{Discussion on the difference between HDO and CH3OH? Since water is formed in gas-phase while CH3OH is not, the similarity of the HDO and CH3OH profiles may further support the dust absorption origin. But this can be done only by Band 6 data...}

\textcolor{red}{Should we show the comparison of dust continuum brightness temperature in Band 3 and Band 6 at higher resolution?}

Another possible explanation for the inner depression of the COM emission is that the molecules inside 40 au are destroyed by the strong UV/X-ray radiation. The UV radiation from the central protostar can destroy COMs via photodissociation \citep[e.g.,][]{Garrod2006, Oberg2009}. Recently, \citet{Notsu2021} modeled the effect of the X-ray radiation from the central protostar on the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes, and found that the gas-phase fractional abundance of \methanol and other COMs decreases within their snowlines as the X-ray luminosity of the central protostar increases. In the presence of the strong X-ray radiation, COMs are mainly destroyed by the X-ray-induced photodissociation \citep[e.g.,][]{Garrod2006, Taquet2016, Notsu2021}. While the efficiency of the destruction of the molecules could be lower for higher gas density than the lower-density envelopes \citep{Notsu2021}, a similar mechanism may work in the innermost region of the V883 Ori disk, where the UV/X-ray luminosity can also be increased due to the outburst of the central star, in particular in the low-density disk surface.

\textcolor{red}{Any comments/additional discussions? Are there any references that should be cited here? Feel free to edit the sentences in the paragraph just above... $\to$ Notsu-san}

In summary, we suggest that the apparent absorption of the molecular line emission by the bright dust continuum emission, or the chemical destruction of the molecules, or combination of them, can explain the inner depression of the COMs emission in Band 3. Our ALMA Band 3 observations suggest that the observations at further longer wavelengths, where the dust continuum emission should be fainter, with ALMA Band 1, Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and future ngVLA, are essential to directly probe the chemistry of the innermost region of the V883 Ori disk.

\subsection{Chemical abundance ratios of COMs}\label{subsec:abundance_ratio}
Even if it is likely that the emission traces the same component as that of sub-mm observations, it is interesting to examine the chemical abundance of COMs in the V883 Ori disk. Figure \ref{fig:} compares the column density ratios of COMs with respect to \methanol in the V883 Ori disk to those in different evolutionary stages including the protostellar envelopes of the Class 0 protobinary IRAS 16293-2422 A/B \citep[][see also \citealt{Drozdovskaya2019}]{Lykke2017, Jorgensen2018, Manigand2020, Manigand2021}, the protoplanetary disk around Oph-IRS 48 \citep{Brunken2022}, and solar system comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko \citep[][see also \citealt{Drozdovskaya2019}]{Rubin2019, Schuhmann2019}. We found higher abundance ratios of COMs in the V883 Ori disk compared to those in the protostellar envelopes of IRAS 16293-2422 by a factor of $\gtrsim$ 5--10, indicating that the abundance of chemically complex species are enhanced in protoplanetary disks. The COM abundance ratios in V883 Ori disk are similar to those in another disk Oph-IRS 48 where the ratios are measured and the comet 67P, except for one species, \methylformate, which shows a lower abundance ratios in comet compared to the disks. These results suggest that the complex species efficiently form during evolution from the protostellar envelope to the protoplanetary disks, and the chemical composition of disks may be inherited to planetary systems without drastic chemical reprocessing. 

In general, formation of COMs are considered to occur mainly via reactions on dust grain surfaces \citep[][and references therein]{Herbst2009}. In the cold temperature region ($\lesssim 10$\,K), the \methanol ice forms via efficient hydrogenation of the CO ice \citep[e.g.,][]{Tielens1982, Watanabe2002, Watanabe2003}. Therefore, the \methanol ice forms in cold molecular clouds and could be delivered to protoplanetary disks, where we observe desorbed \methanol ices. On the other hand, on the warmer (30--50\,K) dust grain surfaces, more complex molecules such as \acetaldehyde, \methylformate, \dimethylether, and \acetone form via reactions of heavier radicals (e.g., CH$_3$, CH$_2$OH, and CH$_3$O), which are generated via the UV/X-ray photolysis of simpler molecules including \methanol \citep[e.g.,][]{Garrod2006, Garrod2008, Oberg2009, Walsh2014, Furuya2014, Notsu2021}. For example, theoretical and experimental studies \citep[e.g.,][]{Garrod2006, Chuang2016} have shown that \acetaldehyde, \methylformate, \dimethylether, and \acetone mainly form via radical-radical reactions,
\begin{align}
    \mathrm{HCO} + \mathrm{CH_3} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{CH_3CHO}, \label{eq:r-r_reaction1} \\ 
    \mathrm{HCO} + \mathrm{CH_3O} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{CH_3OCHO}, \label{eq:r-r_reaction2} \\
    \mathrm{CH_3} + \mathrm{CH_3O} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{CH_3OCH_3}, \label{eq:r-r_reaction3} \\
    \mathrm{CH_3} + \mathrm{CH_3CO} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{CH_3COCH_3}. \label{eq:r-r_reaction4}
\end{align}
In addition to these grain-surface reactions, some gas-phase reactions and/or the UV/X-ray radiation from the central star are also considered to contribute to the formation/destruction of complex molecules \citep[e.g.,][]{Garrod2006, Nomura2009, Taquet2016, Aikawa2020}. 

Since the duration timescale of the FU Ori outburst is $\sim10^1$--$10^2$ yr, which is quite shorter than the typical timescale of gas-phase reactions \citep[$\sim10^4$ yr; e.g.,][]{Nomura2009}, and the outburst of V883 Ori seems to have began before 1888 \citep{Pickering1890}, the observed COM abundance ratios would directly reflect the ice composition, i.e., flesh sublimates without chemical composition being altered by gas-phase synthesis. Therefore, formation of complex molecules during the delivery from the envelope to the disk rather than the gas-phase alternation during the outburst would be responsible for the observed difference in the chemical composition of COMs. Indeed, the typical timescale of grain surface reactions ($\sim10^5$--$10^6$ yr) are comparable to the typical lifetime of Class I/II disks ($\sim$ 1 Myr), which makes it possible to efficiently form complex molecules.

The present observations have also detected several isomeric pairs, i.e., \acetaldehyde and \ethyleneoxide pair and \acetone and \propanal pair. The abundance ratios between isomers are key to constraining the formation pathways. We found an \acetaldehyde/\ethyleneoxide ratio of $9.2_{-1.1}^{+1.2}$ and an \acetone/\propanal ratios of $2.2_{-0.4}^{+0.4}$ in the V883 Ori disk. These ratios are consistent within an order of magnitude compared to the values in IRAS 16293-2422 B \citep{Lykke2017}, suggesting that the isomers are similarly formed as well.  

% Among the detected COMs, \propenal is the least abundant molecules.

Note that while all the cometary values are limited to be upper limits because cometary measurement (mass spectra) cannot distinguish the isomeric molecules with the same mass (e.g., \acetaldehyde and \ethyleneoxide pair and \acetone and \propanal pair), the upper limit of \acetaldehyde in the IRS 48 disk is due to non-detection.}

\subsection{Isotopic ratios of COMs}
The present observations have also detected several isotopologues, including D and $^{13}$C, of some abundant molecules. Here we discuss implications of these detections and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and D/H ratios to the isotopic chemistry in protoplanetary disks. 

\subsubsection{$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio}
Two $^{13}$C isotopologues of \acetaldehyde and \methylformate have been detected. No transitions of the $^{13}$C isotopologue of \methanol, $^{13}$\methanol, were covered in our spectral setup, but it has been detected in Band 6 observations \citep{Lee2019}. Since \citet{Lee2019} uses $^{13}$\methanol to derive the column density of normal \methanol due to the optical thickness of the \methanol transitions observed assuming the ISM $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of 69, no reliable estimates of $^{12}$\methanol/$^{13}$\methanol have been obtained. On the other hand, the transitions of main isotopologues of \acetaldehyde and \methylformate covered in the present observations include optically thin ones, and the $^{13}$C isotopologues of them are also detected, which enables us to deduce reliable estimates of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs for the first time.  

Figure \ref{fig:12C13C} shows the probability density distributions of \acetaldehyde/CH$_3^{13}$CHO and \methylformate/CH$_3$O$^{13}$CHO column density ratios. The measured \acetaldehyde/CH$_3^{13}$CHO and \methylformate/CH$_3$O$^{13}$CHO ratios are $28_{-7}^{+14}$ and $21_{-2}^{+3}$, respectively, which are significantly lower than the value observed in the local interstellar medium ($\sim$ 69; \citealt{Wilson1999}), although the \acetaldehyde/CH$_3^{13}$CHO ratio has a small probability on higher values as well. Recently, \citet{Yoshida2022_12CO13CO} has reported a low $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio ($21\pm5$) in the inner reion (70--110 au) of the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya \citep[see also][]{Zhang2017}. They suggest that the gas-phase isotope-exchange reaction, $^{13}\mathrm{C}^+ + ^{12}\mathrm{CO} \to {}^{12}\mathrm{C}^+ + {}^{13}\mathrm{CO} + \Delta E$ ($\Delta E = 35$\,K; \citealt{Langer1984, Furuya2011}), with the aid of the high gas-pahse C/O ratio ($> 1$), would lead to an enhancement of $^{13}$C (i.e., low $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio) in warm molecular layer. The same mechanism would naturally explain the observed low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in COMs if the $^{13}$C-rich CO is incorporated into the ice on dust grains in the disk midplane via vertical mixing and freeze-out \citep{Charnley2004}, from which the COMs such as \acetaldehyde and \methylformate are synthesized via hydrogenation and radical-radical reactions (Equation (\ref{eq:r-r_reaction1})--(\ref{eq:r-r_reaction4})) on dust grain surfaces.

An alternative mechanism that may alter the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio is the slight difference in the binding energies between two isotopologues. \citet{Smith2015} proposed that the slightly higher binding energy of $^{13}$CO than that of $^{12}$CO ($840\pm4$\,K and $835\pm5$\,K on $^{12}$CO ice; \citealt{Smith2021}) could explain the high $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratios in gas phase ($\sim85$--165) observed toward several low-mass young stellar objects. The difference in binding energies leads to the sublimation of $^{12}$CO at a slightly lower temperature than $^{13}$CO, making the gas-phase CO $^{13}$C-poor (and CO ice $^{13}$C-rich). Therefore, the low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios observed in COMs, which form within ice, may imply that this mechanism is at work as well, although the gas and dust dynamics in disks (e.g., vertical turbulent mixing) is a critical unknown factor to settle the carbon fractionation of CO and, consequently, COMs \citep[e.g.,][]{Yoshida2022_12CO13CO}.

In the warm envelope around the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16293-2422 B, similar lower values of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio ($\sim$ 30) in CH$_2$(OH)CHO (glycolaldehyde), \dimethylether, and potentially \methylformate, have been observed \citep{Jorgensen2016, Jorgensen2018}. With the fact that the COMs are likely to be synthesized efficiently in disks as well (Section \ref{subsec:abundance_ratio}), this indicates that the carbon isotope fractionation are continuously at work during star and planet formation processes. 

It is also interesting to investigate if there are any differences in $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio between different functional groups, i.e., the CHO- and CH$_3$- branches. If the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C is different

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{D/H ratio}
Deuterium fractionation (an enhancement of D/H ratios in interstellar molecules) are also key to understanding the formation environment and thermal history of molecules \citep[e.g.,][]{Ceccarelli2014, Nomura2023_PPVII}. The D/H ratios of COMs, in particular \methanol, has been measured in warm protostellar envelopes \citep[e.g.,][]{Jorgensen2018, Drozdovskaya2021}. Even multiply-deuterated species have been detected mainly toward IRAS 16293-2422 protobinary \citep[e.g.,][]{Manigand2019, Richard2021, Drozdovskaya2022}, and the similar deuteration levels in solar system comets pointed to the inheritance of molecules \citep{Drozdovskaya2021}. In protoplanetary disks, while D/H ratios of several simpler molecules such as HCN, HCO$^{+}$, and N$_2$H$^{+}$ have been measured \citep[e.g.,][see also \citealt{Aikawa2022}]{Cataldi2021}, no measurements of COM deuteration exist so far. 

The deuterium fractionation is initiated by the deuteration of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$ with the gas-phase ion-molecule reaction, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:deuteration}
    \mathrm{H}_3^+ + \mathrm{HD} \rightarrow \mathrm{H_2D^+} + \mathrm{H_2} + \Delta E.
\end{equation}
This reaction is exothermic ($\Delta E \approx 230$\,K; e.g., \citealt{Millar1989}), and therefore at the low temperature ($\lesssim 30$\,K) the backward reaction is suppressed, enhancing the $\mathrm{H_2D^+}$ abundance in gas phase. In addition, the depletion of molecules that destroy $\mathrm{H_2D^+}$, mainly CO, from the gas-phase is also an important factor that enhances the gas-phase fractionation \citep[e.g.,][]{Roberts2000}. The deuteration is inherited to the ice phase as D atoms, which subsequently causes the deuteration of molecules which are formed on dust grain surfaces, including COMs. In the warmer conditions ($\gtrsim 30$\,K), the backward reaction of Equation (\ref{eq:deuteration}) is not severely suppressed and the CO is not depleted onto the dust grains, reducing the D/H ratios of both gas-phase and solid-phase species.

The present observations have detected multiple deuterated species of COMs, \methanol and \acetaldehyde, for the first time in protoplanetary disks. The deuterated \methanol, CH$_2$DOH, has also been detected in the previous Band 7 observations \citep{Lee2019}. For deuterated \acetaldehyde, two different isomers (CH$_2$DCHO and CH$_3$CDO) have been detected. Figure \ref{fig:12C13C} shows the probability density distributions of CH$_2$DOH/\methanol, CH$_3$CDO/\acetaldehyde, and CH$_2$DCHO/\acetaldehyde column density ratios. The measured D/H ratios of CH$_2$DOH, CH$_3$CDO, and CH$_2$DCHO are $0.0074_{-0.0017}^{+0.0020}$, $0.012_{-0.002}^{+0.002}$, and $0.040_{-0.012}^{+0.013}$, respectively. The CH$_2$DOH/\methanol ratio is slightly lower than the typical values observed in the warm protostellar envelopes ($\sim$ 0.01--0.1; \citealt{Drozdovskaya2021}). \textcolor{red}{reformation of CH3OH} The slightly lower value may indicate that the \methanol also forms on the warmer ($\gtrsim 30$\,K) dust grains in e.g., protoplanetary disks. Furthermore, the present observations also covered several transitions of deuterated \methylformate, CH$_2$DOCHO and CH$_3$OCDO (but both are non-detection), which provided an upper limit of $\lesssim0.02$ for both CH$_2$DOCHO/\methylformate and CH$_3$OCDO/\methylformate ratios. This upper limit indicates that the deuteration of \methylformate is also lower compared to that in IRAS 16293-2422 B ($\sim0.06$; \citealt{Jorgensen2018}), which may also point to the formation on the warmer grains. The deuterated \acetaldehyde has only been detected toward the protostar IRAS 16293-2422 B \citep{Coudert2019}, and the CH$_3$CDO/\acetaldehyde and CH$_2$DCHO/\acetaldehyde ratios are measured to be $\sim0.047$ and $\sim0.014$, respectively \citep{Manigand2020}. These values are comparable to what we found in the V883 Ori disk, but the trend between two isomers are different; while the deuteration of CHO- functional group is significantly higher than that of CH$_3$- functional group even after the statistical correction in IRAS 16293-2422 B \citep{Manigand2020}, the deuteration of these functional groups are similar in the V883 Ori disk after the statistical correction. It should be noted that, however, other COMs do not show such a differential deuteration for different functional groups in IRAS 16293-2422 B \citep{Jorgensen2018}. If the differential deuteration in two functional groups of \acetaldehyde is real, the different behavior of deuteration between IRAS 16293-2422 and the V883 Ori disk may imply that the formation pathways in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks are different (e.g., successive hydrogenation and radical-radical reactions). We caution that, however, the measured D/H ratios of \acetaldehyde are based on the detection of a single transition of deuterated species, and therefore further observations of sufficient number of transitions are needed to confirm our results.

\subsection{Implications for Nitrogen and Sulfur Chemistry}
While many species of oxygen-bearing COMs have been detected in the present observations, only C$_2$H$_3$CN has been tentatively detected as a nitrogen-bearing COM. The spectral setup of the present observations did not cover intense transitions of CH$_3$CN, the most ubiquitously observed nitrogen-bearing COMs in protoplanetary disks \citep[e.g.,][]{Bergner2018}, and therefore it has not been detected. Other nitrogen-bearing COMs are also not detected or not covered in the present spectral setup. In Band 7 observations, CH$_3$CN is the only species of nitrogen-bearing COMs that has been detected \citep{Lee2019}. Even for CH$_3$CN, its column density is lower compared to those of oxygen-bearing COMs \citep{Lee2019}. In summary, the nitrogen-bearing COMs are apparently deficient in the V883 Ori disk compared to the oxygen-bearing COMs.

Recently, \citet{vantHoff2020} suggests that the sublimation of refractory carbonaceous grains at a higher temperature ($\sim300$--500\,K, depending on the gas density) could lead to an enhancement of carbon- and nitrogen-bearing molecules compared to oxygen-bearing molecules in the inner hot region of protostellar envelopes, as the refractories contains more carbon and nitrogen than in volatile ices based on cometary abundances \citep{Rice2018, Rubin2019}. Furthermore, recently-reported evidence of the abundant ammonium salt in comet 67P \citep{Altwegg2020, Poch2020} provides an additional nitrogen source in the inner hot region, since the sublimation temperature of ammonium salt is comparable to that of carbonaceous grains \citep[$\sim200$--250\,K; e.g.,][]{Noble2013, Bergner2016} \citep{Nazari2023} reported a systematic enhancement of the abundance of nitrogen-bearing COMs (CH$_3$CN and C$_2$H$_3$CN) in the inner ``hot'' ($\gtrsim300$\,K) region compared to the ``warm'' ($\sim100$--300\,K) region using the ALMA surveys toward 37 high-mass protostars, providing the first evidence of the carbonaceous grains (and potentially ammonium salt) sublimation.

The sublimation of carbonaceous grains and ammonium salt may explain the apparent deficiency of the nitrogen-bearing COMs in the V883 Ori disk. As discussed in Section \ref{subsec:physicochemical_structure}, the present Band 3 observations (and previous sub-mm observations as well) mainly trace the emission from the intermediate region of the disk ($\sim40$--80\,au) and do not probe the inner region ($\lesssim40$\,au). Therefore, one of the possible explanations for the deficiency of nitrogen-bearing COMs is that the nitrogen-bearing COMs are abundant in the innermost region ($\lesssim40$\,au) while they are hidden by the intense dust emission in ALMA observations (or beam-diluted due to their smaller emitting areas). To fully reveal the nitrogen content in the V883 Ori disk, high-resolution observations at longer wavelengths are needed to avoid the dust absorption. It is also essential to determine the temperature structure of the disk to fully characterize the nitrogen-chemistry in the V883 Ori disk.

The present observations have also detected two sulfur-bearing molecules, SO$_2$ and OCS. \citep{Lee2019} also reported a tentative detection of SO$_2$ in the V883 Ori disk. While they also reported a detection of another sulfur-bearing molecule, CH$_3$SH, the present Band 3 observations did not cover intense transition of CH$_3$SH and therefore not detect. Sulfur-bearing molecules have been routinely observed in protostellar environments and solar system comets, and their potential chemical links have been discussed \citep[e.g.,][]{Drozdovskaya2018}. On the other hand, detection of gas-phase sulfur-bearing molecules are still sparse in Class II disks except for CS and its isotopologue \citep[][and references therein]{LeGal2021}. Recent observations have just began to report the (tentative) detection of sulfur-bearing molecules such as SO, SO$_2$, and SiS in warm disks, which might be originated from the thermal desorption and/or the accretion shock toward the protoplanets \citep{Booth2021, Booth2023, Law2023_SiS}. Since the emission distributions are similar to that of other oxygen-bearing COMs in the V883 Ori disk (see Figure \ref{fig:moment_zero_gallery} for OCS), the SO$_2$ and OCS detected in the present observations likely originate from the thermal sublimation as with the other molecules. The thermally desorbed SO$_2$ and OCS, which suggests their abundances in the solid phase, are also consistent with the ubiquitous detection of SO$_2$ and OCS ices by infrared observations \citep[][and references therein]{Boogert2015}

Sulfur-bearing molecules such as CS and SO have also been used to infer the gas-phase C/O ratio in protoplanetary disks. \textcolor{red}{can we say something about C/O ratio from OCS/SO2 ratio?}

\section{JvM effect and continuum subtraction}\label{appendix:JvM_effect}
Here we describe a brief summary of the Jorsater \& van Moorsel (JvM) effect \citep{JvM, Czekala2021}, and subsequently discuss the continuum subtraction methods, which could mitigate the JvM effect.

The JvM effect could result in incorrect measurements of the flux density on the interferometric images produced by the CLEAN deconvolution method, which was originally discussed in \citet{JvM} and extensively investigated in \citet{Czekala2021}. The CLEAN algorithm iteratively extracts the CLEAN components from the residual image, and this process will be terminated when the peak value of the residual image within the CLEAN mask reaches a user-defined threshold (typically 2--3 $\times$ the RMS level; see Figure 2 in \citet{Czekala2021} for a comprehensive summary of this procedure). The final image product of CLEAN is the sum of the CLEANed model image (convolved with a CLEAN beam determined by a Gaussian fit to the dirty beam) and the residual images, which have inconsistent units (Jansky per CLEAN beam and Jansky per dirty beam). Therefore, if faint emission below the CLEAN threshold remains on the residual image, the intensity scale in the final image can be incorrect (i.e., sum of values with two different units). The impact of this effect depends on the emission strengths, the CLEAN threshold, and the deviation of the dirty beam shape from the CLEAN beam shape (Gaussian): if a significant portion of the emission remains on the residual image and the deviation is large, the intensity scale in the final image will drastically modified from the correct intensity scale \citep{JvM, Czekala2021}.  

To correct for this unit inconsistency, \citet{Czekala2021} applied the ``JvM correction'' to the line emission in protoplanetary disks, where the residual image is scaled before the addition with the CLEANed model image by the ratio of the dirty beam area to the CLEAN beam area, forcing the unit of the residual image to be Jansky per CLEAN beam. However, \citet{Casassus2022} pointed out that the JvM correction can artificially manipulate the noise levels and exaggerate the signal-to-noise ratio of the emission, as the correction will scale the residual image that contains the noise typically by a factor smaller than unity. So far, no concrete solution for this problem has been drawn.

We applied the JvM correction to our data following \citet{Czekala2021}, which obtained a JvM $\epsilon$ (the ratio of dirty beam area to the CLEAN beam area) of $\sim0.28$, indicating that the effect is severe. This could result in a drastic underestimation of the uncertainties of physical quantities derived from the fits described in Section \ref{sec:analysis_result}. Another possible solution is CLEANing deeper (e.g., down to 0.5--1 $\times$ the RMS level) so that all the emission components are recovered, but this would be unrealistic as too deep CLEANing will not converge and it is practically unfeasible to CLEAN down to such deep levels particularly for the line image cubes with a lot of channels. Alternatively, we mitigate the JvM effect and recover correct flux scale as much as possible by employing the continuum subtraction on the image plane (with the CASA task \texttt{imcontsub}) rather than on the visibility plane (with the CASA task \texttt{uvcontsub}). The line emission in our data is almost co-spatial to the strong continuum emission, and therefore imaging without continuum subtraction can almost completely include the line emission into the CLEAN model, thanks to the strong line plus continuum intensity well above the CLEAN threshold. While the continuum component is still affected by the JvM effect, the line emission can be safely recovered by subsequent continuum subtraction on the image plane. Figure \ref{fig:JvM_spectrum} shows an example demonstrating that almost no spectral line component remain in the residual spectrum and the line emission is almost fully recovered in the CLEANed image. We note that this method is only applicable to the spectral line data associated with a strong continuum emission. If the continuum emission is faint in the emitting region of the spectral line, the spectral line component will still remain in the residual even with the continuum subtraction on the image plane.

\section{LTE spectral model}\label{appendix:spectral_model}
Here we describe the details of the spectral model which is fitted to the spectra corrected for Keplerian rotation for column density derivation. We assume that the excitation condition of observed COM emission is well approximated by local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), where the gas temperature is equal to the excitation temperature ($T_\mathrm{ex}$) of the emitting molecules. This assumption should be reasonable as the typical gas density in protoplanetary disks () is higher than the typical critical density of the COM transitions. For example, the critical density of xx-yy transition of \methanol is calculated to be zzz cm-3 at a gas kinetic temperature of 100 K \citep[ref][]{}. We further assume that different species are sufficiently cospatial to share the same emitting region size and excitation temperature. This assumption is also broadly supported by the similar emission extent of different COMs shown in Figure \ref{fig:moment_zero_gallery}. 

The model intensity $I_\nu$ are computed based on a solution of the basic radiative transfer equations for an isothermal, uniform slab:
\begin{equation}
    I_\nu = (B_\nu(T_\mathrm{ex}) - B_\nu(T_\mathrm{CMB})) (1 - e^{-\tau_\nu}),
\end{equation}
where $B_\nu$ is the Planck function for a blackbody radiation, $T_\mathrm{CMB} = 2.73$ K is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background, and $\tau_\nu$ is the optical depth of the line emission at a frequency $\nu$. Mimicking the formulation described in Appendix A of \citet{Yamato2022}, the line optical depth $\tau_\nu$ is computed considering different transitions from various species as
\begin{equation}
    \tau_\nu = \sum_{i}\tau_{0, i} \exp\bigg(-\frac{(\nu - \nu_\mathrm{c})^2}{2 \sigma_\nu^2}\bigg),
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the indices for different transitions, $\tau_{0, i}$ is the optical depth at the line center of $i$th transition, $\nu_\mathrm{c}$ is the central frequency of the transition, and $\sigma_\nu$ is the line width in terms of frequency. The central frequency $\nu_\mathrm{c}$ is calculated as $\nu_\mathrm{c} = \nu_0 (1 - v_\mathrm{sys}/c)$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $v_\mathrm{sys}$ is the systemic velocity of the source, assumed to be $4.25$ km s$^{-1}$ for V883 Ori \citep{Tobin2023}. The frequency line width $\sigma_\nu$ is converted from the velocity line width $\sigma_v$ as $\sigma_\nu = \nu_0 \sigma_v / c$, where $\nu_0$ is the rest frequency of each transition listed in Table \ref{tab:transitions}. In practice, the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the velocity $\Delta V_\mathrm{FWHM}$ is used as a parameter instead of $\sigma_\nu$ or $\sigma_v$. The optical depth at the line center ($\tau_\mathrm{0, i}$) is calculated as
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{0, i} = \frac{c^2A_\mathrm{u}N_\mathrm{u}}{8\pi\nu_0^2\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_\nu}\Bigg(\exp\left(\frac{h\nu_0}{k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{ex}}\right) - 1\Bigg),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{N_\mathrm{u}}{N} = \frac{g_\mathrm{u}}{Q(T_\mathrm{ex})}\exp\left(-\frac{E_\mathrm{u}}{k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{ex}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $A_\mathrm{ul}$ is the Einstein A coefficient for spontaneous emission, $g_\mathrm{u}$ is the upper state degeneracy, $N$ is the molecular column density, $Q$ is the partition function of the molecule, and $E_\mathrm{u}$ is the upper state energy of the transition. While this suit of formulation is similar to that of the eXtended CASA Line Analysis Software Suite (XCLASS; \citealt{Moller2017}), which is used in a previous work on the V883 Ori disk \citep{Lee2019}, we used an independent implementation by ourselves for technical flexibility.

The model intensity $I_\nu$ (in unit of Jy sr$^{-1}$) is then integrated over a solid angle of the emitting region $\Omega$, which is common for all transitions and species, to obtain the spectra of flux density (in unit of Jy). In practice, we assumed an axisymmetric emission distribution in the disk and the radius of the emitting region $r$ (considering the disk inclination) is used as a parameter, i.e., $\Omega = \pi r^2 \cos i$. Finally, the model flux density spectra are convolved with a Lorentz function $f(\nu)$ with a width of $\gamma$,
\begin{equation}
    f(\nu) = \frac{1}{\pi\gamma} \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma^2 + \nu^2},
\end{equation}
to take line broadening in the spectra corrected for Keplerian rotation. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Lorentzian_demo}, the spectra corrected for Keplerian rotation still deviates from a simple Gaussian due to (1) the finite spatial resolution or beam smearing, which cannot fully resolve the highest velocity component of Keplerian rotation and (2) potential emission from the elevated disk surface of the back side and front side of the disk, which have different projected velocities. In our data, both (1) and (2) could be dominant causes of the deviation, since the spatial resolution is not so high to fully resolve the disk emission and the COM emission could originate from the warm disk surface in addition to the midplane, as already shown in the Band 6 data (M. Leemker et al. in preparation). Figure \ref{fig:Lorentzian_demo} demonstrates that the convolution with the Lorentz function well approximates the deviation from Gaussian while conserving the velocity-integrated flux density, which is relevant for column density derivation. Furthermore, to account for the finite spectral resolution, the model spectra is additionally convolved with a Gaussian function with a FWHM of the spectral resolution. This process also accounts for the different spectral resolutions (per channel width) between SPW 10 and others (see Table \ref{tab:cube_properties}). A similar approach has been employed in the spectral line analysis in protoplanetary disks \citep{Cataldi2021}, where they used only a Gaussian convolution to take the line broadening into account (see also \citealt{Bergner2021, Guzman2021}).



% In total, we consider 19 free parameters:  $r, T_\mathrm{ex}, \gamma, \Delta V_\mathrm{FWHM}$, and $N$ for 15 species. The fit

The horizontal dashed line and vertical dotted line marks the zero-flux level and the systemic velocity ($v_\mathrm{sys} = 4.25$ km s$^{-1}$), respectively.}

\section{Spectroscopic data for molecules}\label{appendix:spectroscopic_data}
To employ the astronomical modeling of the observed spectra and estimate column density, spectroscopic data such as transition frequencies, intrinsic line strengths, and partition functions are essential information. They are basically retrieved from the Cologne
Database of Molecular Spectroscopy \citep[CDMS;][]{CDMS1, CDMS2, CDMS3} or the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) database \citep{JPL}. We describe the origin of these data and molecule-specific issues for each species below, with a particular care on the vibratinonal contributions to the partition functions. We also summarize the origin of these data in Table \ref{}.

\subsection{Methanol}
Spectroscopic data for \methanol are taken from the CDMS, which are largely based on the theoretical calculation for the ground state ($v_t = 0$) and the first three torsional states ($v_t = 1, 2, 3$) by \citet{Xu2008}. The partition function of \methanol which considers the contributions from these states is also available in the CDMS. 

The data for the deuterated isotopologues, CH$_2$DOH, are taken from the JPL database, which is based on the laboratory experiment for the ground torsional state \citep{Pearson2012}. The partition function available in the JPL database only considers the ground torsional state. \citet{Taquet2019} estimated the vibrational correction factor of 1.15 for the partition function at 160~K based on the torsional dataset in \citet{Lauvergnat2009}. As the vibrational contributions are less dominant at lower temperatures, the correction factor for the partition function (and thus directly column density) should be smaller than $\sim1.1$ at the temperature of 100--110~K derived by the fit in the present work. This small contribution of the vibrational states does not significantly affect the overall results and discussions, in particular for the D/H ratios of \methanol. Therefore, we do not apply any specific correction factors to the partition function of CH$_2$DOH.  

\subsection{Acetaldehyde}
The data for \acetaldehyde are taken from the JPL database. This is based on the data listed in \citep{Kleiner1996} for the ground state ($v_t = 0$) and the first two torsional states ($v_t = 1, 2$). The partition function of \acetaldehyde available in the JPL database also considers these three torsional states. 

There are two isomers of $^{13}$C-acetaldehyde: $^{13}$CH$_3$CHO and CH$_3^{13}$CHO. The data of both isomers for the ground state ($v_t = 0$) and the first torsional state ($v_t = 1$) are available at the CDMS based on the laboratory measurement by \citep{Margules2015}. The partition function which considers the contributions from torsional states up to $v_t = 8$ is also available at the CDMS.

There are also two isomers of deuterated acetaldehyde: CH$_2$DCHO and CH$_3$CDO. While the data of the ground states ($v_t = 0$) and the first torsional states ($v_t = 1$) are available for CH$_3$CDO at the CDMS, only the data of the ground states ($v_t = 0$) exists for CH$_2$DCHO. These data are based on the laboratory experiments by \citet{Coudert2019}. The partition functions of these molecules are available at the CDMS. The partition function of CH$_2$CDO are calculated considering the contributions from the first three torsional modes and the approximate contributions from the lowest vibrational mode. The partition function for CH$_2$DCHO are, on the other hand, calculated considering the approximate contributions from the lowest torsional mode and the lowest vibrational mode.


\subsection{Methyl Formate}
We used the spectroscopic data for \methylformate taken from the JPL database. This data is based on the laboratory experiment for the ground states ($v_t = 0$) and the first torsional state ($v_t = 1$) by \citet{Ilyushin2009}. Similar to acetaldehyde, there are two $^{13}$C-isotopologues of methyl formate: $^{13}$CH$_3$OCHO and CH$_3$O$^{13}$CHO. While the data of the ground states ($v_t = 0$) and the first torsional state ($v_t = 1$) for CH$_3$O$^{13}$CHO are available at the CDMS, which is based on the laboratory measurements \citep[][and references therein]{Carvajal2010}, no CDMS entry for $^{13}$CH$_3$OCHO are found. Instead, we compiled the experimental data and theoretical predictions for $^{13}$CH$_3$OCHO transitions from literature \citep{Carvajal2009, Haykal2014, Favre2014}. 

For the partition function of these three molecules, we used the one calculated by \citet{Favre2014}. \citet{Favre2014} fully considered the contributions from torsional (up to $v_t=6$) and vibrational populations. The partition function data exist in the JPL database as well for the normal isotopologues (\methylformate), but only the contributions from $v_t = 0, 1$ states are considered. This resulted in a difference between the one by \citet{Favre2014} and the one in the JPL database by a factor of 1.2 at 150~K and 2.5 at 300~K \citep{Favre2014}. We note that there are difference in the treatment of the degeneracy, where \citet{Favre2014} ignore the nuclear spin degeneracy (i.e., $g_\mathrm{I} = 1$) while the CDMS and JPL entries take $g_\mathrm{I} = 2$. To take this difference into account, we multiply the partition function listed in \citet{Favre2014} by two in practice.

We also examined the data for deuterated methyl formate. Similarly, there are two isomers: CH$_2$DOCHO and CH$_3$OCDO. Spectroscopic data for both molecules are taken from the CDMS, which is based on the experimental measurement by \citet{Coudert2013} and \citet{Margules2009} for CH$_2$DOCHO, and \citet{Margules2010} and \citet{Duan2015} for CH$_3$OCDO. The partition functions of these molecules available in the CDMS only take the ground vibrational state into account. 
\textcolor{blue}{\citet{Manigand2019} uses the vibrational correction factor of 1.31 and 1.11 at 115~K for CH$_2$OCHO and CH$_3$OCDO, respectively, assuming that the correction factor is the same as $^{13}$C-isotopologues. We applied these factors to the partition functions of these molecules.}


\subsection{Dimethyl Ether}
The data for \dimethylether are taken from the CDMS, which is based on the experimental measurement by \citet{Endres2009} for the ground vibrational states ($v = 0$) with four substates (AA, AE, EA, and EE). The partition function is calculated considering the torsionally excited states ($v_{11} = 1$ and $v_{15} = 1$), C-O-C bending states ($v_7 = 1$), and $v_{11} + v_{15} = 2$, and available at the CDMS. 

The spectroscopic data for $^{13}$C isotopologue ($^{13}$\dimethylether) are also available at the CDMS and based on the laboratory experiments by \citet{Koerber2013}. The partition function in the CDMS is calculated only taking the ground vibrational states into account, and the vibrational correction factor is not yet available.   

\subsection{Acetone}
The data for \acetone are taken from the JPL. The JPL entry compiled the data from \citet{Peter1965}, \citet{Vacherand1986}, \citet{Oldag1992}, and \citet{Groder2002}. The partition function which takes into account the torsional and vibrational state are available at the JPL and used for the spectral fit. 

\subsection{Ethylene Oxide}
The data for \ethyleneoxide are taken from the CDMS. This CDMS entry is based on the experimental data in \citet{Creswell1974} and \citet{Muller2022}. The partition function available at the CDMS takes into account the ground vibrational state only, and the vibrational correction factor is not available.

\subsection{Propenal}
The data for \propenal are taken from the CDMS, which are largely based on the experimental data in \citet{Daly2015} with additional data from \citet{Winnewisser1975} and \citet{Cherniak1966}. The partition function is calculated by considering no vibrational states nor other conformers, and the vibrational and conformational correction factors are not yet available. We thus do not apply any correction factors to the partition function.

\subsection{Propanal}
The data for \propanal are taken from the CDMS, which are largely based on the experimental measurements by \citet{Zingsheim2017} with additional data from \citet{Hardy1982} and \citet{Demaison1987}. The partition function is calculated by considering no vibrational states nor other conformers, and the vibrational and conformational correction factors are not yet available. We thus do not apply any correction factors to the partition function.
